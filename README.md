## Set Up and Installation

Details on how to set up the project follow.

- Download Visual Studio Code if not already installed. Link - https://code.visualstudio.com/
- Install Node.js if not already installed. You should have the option to automatically install tools, make sure it is selected. Link - https://nodejs.org/en/download
- You will need the react, react-dom, and next packages. You can get them using the command `npm install next@latest react@latest react-dom@latest` in the terminal.
- TailWind CSS is also needed. You can install it with the command `npm install tailwindcss @tailwindcss/postcss postcss` in the terminal.
- Clone the repository and save it locally on your machine. Remember where it is located. If using the terminal to clone, you may have to use the SSH link instead of the HTTPS link. This can be done with `git clone git@github.com:FranklinUniversityCompSciPracticum/SU25_Team6.git`.
- Using the terminal, navigate into the main jet-set-go folder and use the command `npm run dev`. 
- Once the command is done, navigate to http://localhost:3000/ and let it load. It took about a minute for me to load.
- You should now see the default Next.js page. ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9e97be2e-c27e-4ded-bd4a-09050dbd45c4)
